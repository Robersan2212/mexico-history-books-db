# Overview

I developed a comprehensive Node.js application that manages a collection of Mexican history books using Firebase Firestore as the cloud database backend. The software demonstrates full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with role-based authentication and secure access control.

# Cloud Database

I am using Firebase Firestore, a flexible, scalable NoSQL document database built on Google Cloud infrastructure. Firestore is specifically designed for mobile, web, and server development, offering real-time data synchronization and offline support. As a cloud-hosted database, Firestore provides automatic multi-region data replication, strong consistency guarantees, and can handle intensive database workloads with automatic scaling.
